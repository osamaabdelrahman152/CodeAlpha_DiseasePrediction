# CodeAlpha - Disease Prediction (Breast Cancer Dataset)

This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.  
It is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting breast cancer using **basic preprocessing and ML models**.

---

##  Steps
1. Load dataset (Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn).
2. Preprocessing: StandardScaler for normalization.
3. Train/Test Split (80/20).
4. Train three models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
5. Evaluate models using:
   - Accuracy
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)
   - Confusion Matrix (with heatmap visualization)

---

##  Results
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved high accuracy (> 90%).  
- Confusion Matrices are plotted for each model in the notebook.

##  How to Run
1. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
  # pip install -r requirements.txt
